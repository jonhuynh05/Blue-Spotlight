Blue Spotlight is a rating site geared specifically towards the contractor market. Contractors are able to upload their information to Blue Spotlight, and users are able to come to the site to rate contractors they've worked with, in addition to finding highly rated contractors in the field.

With Blue Spotlight, I aimed to create a solution to finding contractors. Oftentimes, only large companies have visibility online and local contractors have too few reviews to help people choose the right contractor for them. Blue Spotlight can become the one-stop-shop for all contractor rating needs.


## User Flow

1. Both professional contractors and the general public are able to sign up with Blue Spotlight. They are able to select their account type upon registration.

2. Once registered or logged in, users will be able to access all other areas of the site. Upon login, they are taken to their respectve home pages where they can edit their profiles and search for contractors.

3. When a user begins looking for their contractor, they will be able to see each contractors average rating and have the ability to write a review.

4. If they click on the contractors, they will be able to see all reviews that have been written about the contractor.

5. From there, users can also click into reviewer profiles to see other contractors a reviewer has rated.

6. As usage increase, the contractor database will grow and their average ratings will become more accurate over time. Users will then be able to make more and more accurate choices when they have work that needs to be done on their properties.
